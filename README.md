## What is it?

Autumn is an application framework with a template, using LWJGL (OpenGL, GLFW, etc.)

##### Built with Java 1.8

Sadly we currently have only 2 dimensions, but I promise that the 3th is coming soon

You can customize and implement anything.

##### Only supports windows (for now)

## How to use it

**Without a Java IDE**

Open the root directory, and in Project/src you will find 2 folders.<br> One called Project and one called Autumn, Autumn folder is where the source code for Autumn is,<br>and the Project folder is where your Main file is

To compile you will go to scripts and run the Compile.bat script, and if all goes well you have an Autumn application!

**With a Java IDE**

Open the root folder with all the folders.<br>Set the needed settings and run it, and if all goes well you have an Autumn application!

## Requirements
